In React Native, a subtle issue can occur when using `useEffect` with a cleanup function and asynchronous operations. If the cleanup function performs an asynchronous task (like fetching data or making an API call) and the component unmounts before the task completes, the asynchronous task might still continue to run, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.  This is especially problematic if the task relies on component state that no longer exists after unmounting. For example:

```javascript
useEffect(() => {
  const fetchData = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('some_url');
    setData(await response.json());
  };

  fetchData();

  return () => {
    // This cleanup function attempts to abort the fetch, but may not always succeed.
    // The fetch might already be complete, or the abort may not be handled properly.
    controller.abort();
  };
}, []);
```
